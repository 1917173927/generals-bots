## [2026-05-13 18:10] PPO Training Repair
- **Changes:** Repaired experimental PPO training scripts, declared Equinox/Optax dependencies, fixed policy visualization imports, corrected core army-growth timing, and added an English devlog under `docs/devlogs/`.
- **Status:** Completed
- **Next Steps:** Add a dedicated PPO smoke test and evaluate longer training runs before making policy-quality claims.
- **Context:** Devlog generation must remain outside runtime training code; the raw PPO trainer is the primary supported experimental path.

## [2026-05-13 18:28] CUDA 13 JAX Environment Repair
- **Changes:** Added a reproducible CUDA 13 optional dependency extra, raised the JAX/JAXLIB floor to the installed 0.10 line, and documented GPU setup verification.
- **Status:** Completed
- **Next Steps:** Investigate the remaining non-fatal NVIDIA driver-version parse log if clean stderr is required; PPO training now runs with `JAX_PLATFORMS=cuda`.
- **Context:** The machine has an RTX 5070 Ti with driver 595.79/CUDA 13.2; the failure mode was a stale `jax-cuda13-plugin==0.9.2` beside `jax/jaxlib==0.10.0`.
